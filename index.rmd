<span class='logo_span'>LINEA</span> is an open-source R library aimed at simplifying and accelerating the development of linear models to understand the relationship between two or more variables. 

Linear models are commonly used in a variety of contexts including natural and social sciences, and various business applications (e.g. marketing, finance). 

This page covers a basic how to setup the `linea` library to analyse a time-series. We'll cover:

* [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites): Prerequisites of using the library
* [Installation](#Installation): Installing and checking the library
* [Quick Start](#Quick Start): What `linea` can do

## Prerequisites

To use this library an understanding of the following is assumed:

* [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Installation  

The library can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages('linea')` or from GitHub using `devtools::install_github('paladinic/linea')`.
Once installed you can check the installation.

```{r}
print(packageVersion("linea"))
```

## Quick Start

The `linea` library works well with pipes. Used with dplyr and plotly, it can perform data analysis and visualization with elegant code.
Let's build a quick model to illustrate what `linea` can do.


### Import Data

We start by importing `linea`, some other useful libraries, and some data.

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

# librarise
library(linea) # modelling
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation
library(plotly) # visualization
library(DT) # visualization

# fictitious ecommerce data
data_path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paladinic/data/main/ecomm_data.csv'

# importing flat file
data = read_xcsv(file = data_path)

# adding seasonality and Google trends variables
data = data %>% 
  get_seasonality(date_col_name = 'date',date_type = 'weekly starting') %>%
  gt_f(kw = 'prime day',append = T)

# visualize data
data %>%
  datatable(rownames = NULL,
            options = list(scrollX = TRUE))

```

### Run Models

Now lets build a model to understand what drives changes in the `ecommerce` variable.
We can start by selecting a few initial independent variables (i.e. `christmas`,`black.friday`,`trend`,`gtrends_prime day`)

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

model = run_model(data = data,
                  dv = 'ecommerce',
                  ivs = c('christmas','black.friday','trend','gtrends_prime day'),
                  id_var = 'date')

summary(model)

```

Our next steps can be guided by functions like `what_next()`, which will test all other variables in our data.
From the output below, it seems like the variables `covid` and `offline_media` would improve the model most.

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

model %>% 
  what_next()

```

Adding these variables to model brings the adjusted R squared to ~88%.

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

model = run_model(data = data,
                  dv = 'ecommerce',
                  ivs = c('christmas','black.friday','trend','gtrends_prime day','covid','offline_media'),
                  id_var = 'date')

summary(model)

```


### Generate Insights

Now that we have a decent model we can start extracting insights from it.
We can start by looking at the contribution of each independent variable over time.

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

model %>% 
  decomp_chart()


```

We can also visualize the relationships between our independent and dependent variables using response curves.
From this we can see that, for example, when `offline_media` is 10, `ecommerce` increases by ~55. 

```{r, warning=F,message=FALSE}

model %>% 
  response_curves(x_min = 0)


```

## Next Steps

1. The <a href="linea_getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> page is a good place to start learning how to build linear models with `linea`.

2. The <a href="linea_advanced_features.html">Advanced Features</a> page shows how to implement the features of `linea` that allow users to capture <b>non-linear relationships</b>.

3. The <a href="linea_additional_features.html">Additional Features</a> page all other functions of the library.

## Coming Soon...

<span class='logo_span'>LINEA</span> is being continuously maintained and improved with several features under development. 

Here are a few improvements in development:

* improving the pooled modelling interface (i.e. meta_data)
* optimizing `linea::what_combo()`
* expanding `linea::hill_function()`

Here are a few features on the way:

* Offset / Fixed coefficients
* VIF
* Model Nesting
* Bayesian Modelling

There are also commercial products being developed:

* Modelling Tool: <span class='logo_span'>LINEAPP</span>
* Optimization, Forecasting and Planning: <span class='logo_span'>LINEAPP+</span>
